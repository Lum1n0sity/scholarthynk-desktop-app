Question answers:

Options Confirmation Window:

Yes, it's allowed to have a single window at the beginning where users can select their preferences and provide consent. This is a common approach to ensure that users actively agree to the terms and conditions, data collection practices, and other relevant settings.
Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions:

It's common to have both a Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions as separate documents. They serve different purposes. The Privacy Policy typically outlines how user data is handled, while Terms and Conditions cover the general rules and terms of use for your app. You can present these separately to users, usually accessible through links during account creation or within the app.
Transferring User Data:

Allowing users to transfer their data to another app means providing a mechanism for users to download or export the data they've contributed or generated within your app. This could include user-generated content, study materials, preferences, etc. This feature ensures that users have control over their data and can use it elsewhere if they choose to do so.
User-Generated Content and Deletion:

If users can add topics and vocabulary that are visible to others, it's a good practice to inform users that this content may remain even after account deletion. Deleting the account can remove personal information associated with the user, but you may need a policy on how to handle user-generated content that has been shared with the community.
Data Transmission Security (HTTPS):

Yes, using HTTPS ensures secure transmission of data between the user's device and your server. This is a fundamental security measure to prevent unauthorized access or data interception during transmission.
Security Protocols:

Security protocols refer to a set of rules and procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This includes encryption methods, access controls, regular security audits, and measures to prevent and respond to security breaches. Implementing security protocols is crucial to safeguard user data from potential threats.
